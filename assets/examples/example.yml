# Sample contexts file

# This is what an initialization could look like:
- batch:
  - context:
      data:
        name: init
      features:
        - test/init.feature

- batch:
  - context:
      data:
        name: context1
      features:
        - test/dummy1.feature
  - context:
      data:
        name: context2
        # You may define variables that are local to a context
        fruit: apples, oranges
      features:
        - test/dummy2.feature
  # You can run several features in a given context
  - context:
      data:
        name: mycontext
      features:
        - test/first.feature
        - test/second.feature

# This is what a termination could look like:
- batch:
  - context:
      data:
        name: end
      features:
        - test/end.feature
